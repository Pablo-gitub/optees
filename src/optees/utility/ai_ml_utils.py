def perform_kmeans_clustering(data, num_clusters):
    """
    Performs K-Means clustering on the given dataset.

    This algorithm partitions data into a specified number of clusters
    to identify patterns or segments within the data.

    Args:
        data (list or numpy.array): The input data to be clustered.
        num_clusters (int): The number of clusters to form.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the cluster labels for each data point
               and the coordinates of the cluster centroids.

def solve_decision_tree(data, target_variable):
    """
    Solves a classification or regression problem using a Decision Tree.

    This algorithm creates a tree-like model of decisions and their possible
    consequences to make predictions.

    Args:
        data (pandas.DataFrame): The input data with features and target variable.
        target_variable (str): The name of the column to predict.

    Returns:
        object: The trained Decision Tree model object.
