def pre_process_lp_data(problem_matrix):
    """
    Pre-processes the LP problem matrix to remove redundant or
    linearly dependent constraints.

    This function aims to optimize the problem for faster solving by
    reducing its dimensionality.

    Args:
        problem_matrix (list or numpy.array): The matrix of constraints.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the optimized matrix and a mapping of
               original vs. new constraint indices.
    """
    # TODO: Implement logic to identify and remove redundant constraints.
    pass

def solve_simplex(problem_data):
    """
    Solves a standard linear programming problem using the Simplex algorithm.

    Args:
        problem_data (dict): A dictionary containing problem details,
                             including objective function, variables, and constraints.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the solution status, optimal value, and variable values.

def solve_knapsack(items, max_capacity):
    """
    Solves a classic Knapsack problem to maximize total value without
    exceeding a given capacity.

    Args:
        items (list of dict): A list of dictionaries, where each dict represents
                              an item with 'weight' and 'value'.
        max_capacity (int or float): The maximum capacity of the knapsack.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the optimal value and the list of selected items.

def solve_branch_and_bound(problem_data):
    """
    Solves an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem using the Branch and Bound algorithm.

    This algorithm is used when some or all variables must be integers.

    Args:
        problem_data (dict): A dictionary containing ILP problem details.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the solution status, optimal value, and integer variable values.

def perform_sensitivity_analysis(solution, problem_data):
    """
    Performs a sensitivity analysis on an LP solution.

    This function determines how changes in objective coefficients or
    constraint bounds affect the optimal solution.

    Args:
        solution (object): The optimal solution object returned by a solver.
        problem_data (dict): The original LP problem data.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary with sensitivity analysis results, including
              shadow prices and reduced costs.
